# BMAD Method Book Project

**Working Title**: BMAD Method: AI-Assisted Agile Development in Practice  
**Author**: Carlos Gorricho  
**Status**: Research Complete, Ready to Begin Writing

---

## Project Overview

This directory contains materials for writing a comprehensive book about the BMAD Method (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development), structured in two main parts:

**Part 1**: BMAD Method background, principles, agent decisions, and workflows  
**Part 2**: Practical implementation using the OFAC sanctions screening project as a real-world case study

---

## Key Research Findings

✅ **First-Mover Opportunity**: NO existing BMAD Method books published (confirmed via web search, Amazon, publisher catalogs)

✅ **Strong Market**: Active BMAD community (Discord, GitHub, Medium articles), growing AI-assisted development adoption

✅ **Ideal Publisher Match**: Pragmatic Bookshelf (founded by Agile Manifesto co-authors Andy Hunt & Dave Thomas)

✅ **Recommended Strategy**: Start with Leanpub MVP (self-publish, validate market, 80% royalties), then pitch to traditional publishers
